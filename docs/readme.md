## Plugin Install Instructions

### Supported IDEs

The Flutter Plugin can be installed on following IntelliJ-based products:

* IntelliJ 2016.2+ ([Ultimate or Community](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/))

### Flutter Plugin Installation

During `alpha` development, the Flutter plugin is hosted in our own plugin repository.  Before it can be installed, the repository needs to be added to the IDE.

1. Open plugin preferences (**Preferences>Plugins**)
1. Select **”Browse repositories…”**
1. In the **Browse Repositories** dialog, click **Manage repositories…”**
1. In the resulting **Custom Plugin Repositories** pop-up, click the **+** button and paste `https://flutter.github.io/flutter-intellij/alpha/updatePlugins.xml` into the **Repository URL:** field and click **OK**
1. In the **Browse Repositories** dialog, select **`flutter-intellij`** from the list of plugins (be sure it is not being filtered out of your results view by specifying **Category: All** or limiting it to the Flutter repository in the pull-down by the search box) and click the green **Install** button
1. Once downloaded, click the **Restart IntelliJ IDEA** button
